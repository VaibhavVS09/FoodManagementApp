# Food Management System (C++)

A robust, console-based CRUD application designed for cafeteria management to track and analyze food calorie data. This project demonstrates proficiency in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **File I/O**, and **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Full CRUD Operations:** Add, View, Update, and Delete food records.
- **Data Persistence:** Uses File Handling to store records in a `.txt` file, ensuring data is retained after the program closes.
- **Advanced Filtering:**
  - Search by name or category (Sweet/Spice).
  - Filter items within specific calorie ranges (200-500).
  - Identify items with above-average calorie counts.
- **Data Analytics:**
  - Calculate average calories across all items.
  - Find the highest and lowest calorie food items.
- **Sorting:** Efficiently sort data by Calories or Name using STL algorithms.
- **Error Handling:** Robust custom exception handling for "Item Not Found" or "Empty Database" scenarios.
